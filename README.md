# Learning Data Science: Projects and Insights

Welcome to my repository, where I showcase a variety of works related to data science. This space will be continuously updated with projects ranging from academic coursework to personal experiments, all aimed at deepening my understanding of data science.

## Current Focus: Deep Learning Commentary

### Project Overview
The file `article_commentary.tex` is a LaTeX-based presentation developed for a Masterâ€™s course in Deep Learning at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC). It provides a critical review of the article "[3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079)."

### Video Presentation
Watch the embedded video below for a comprehensive overview of the article. This video was created using OBS Studio, and its pace was slightly increased to fit the required presentation duration.
